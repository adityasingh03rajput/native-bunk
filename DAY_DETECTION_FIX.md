# Day Detection Bug Fix

## Critical Bug Found

**Problem**: The app was showing **Monday** when it should show **Sunday**, causing:
- Wrong timetable to be displayed
- Classes showing on Sunday (a leave day)
- Incorrect attendance tracking

## Root Cause

In `App.js`, there were TWO places with an incorrect days array:

```javascript
// WRONG - 'Monday' appears twice at index 0 and 1
const days = ['Monday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
```

This caused Sunday (day index 0) to be mapped to 'Monday' instead of 'Sunday'.

## JavaScript Day Indexing

In JavaScript, `Date.getDay()` returns:
- **0 = Sunday**
- 1 = Monday
- 2 = Tuesday
- 3 = Wednesday
- 4 = Thursday
- 5 = Friday
- 6 = Saturday

## Fix Applied

Changed both occurrences in `App.js` to the correct array:

```javascript
// CORRECT - Sunday at index 0
const days = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
```

### Locations Fixed:
1. **Line 162**: Initial state fallback in `useState(() => {...})`
2. **Line 288**: Date change detection in `useEffect`

## Verification

Server time API confirms:
```json
{
  "serverTime": 1761470002583,
  "serverTimeISO": "2025-10-26T09:13:22.583Z",
  "timezone": "Asia/Calcutta"
}
```

Date: **October 26, 2025** = **Sunday** (day index 0)

## Impact

After this fix:
- ✅ Sunday is correctly detected as Sunday
- ✅ `isLeaveDay()` returns `true` for Sunday
- ✅ No classes shown on Sunday
- ✅ Correct timetable displayed for each day
- ✅ Attendance tracking works for correct days

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Check that Sunday shows "Leave Day" or no classes
2. Check that Monday shows Monday's schedule
3. Check that the current day matches the actual day of the week
4. Verify timetable navigation shows correct days

## Note

The `ServerTime.js` file already had the correct array - this bug was only in the fallback code in `App.js`.
