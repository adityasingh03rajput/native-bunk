# 🎯 LetsBunk - The Attendance System That Can't Be Fooled

> **"Try to bunk. We dare you."**

LetsBunk is the world's first **triple-layer attendance verification system** that combines face recognition, WiFi proximity, and ultrasonic mesh networking to create an **impossible-to-fake** attendance tracking solution for educational institutions.

---

## 🚀 The Problem We Solve

**Traditional attendance systems fail because:**
- ❌ Biometric machines: Long queues, fixed locations, expensive (₹10-12 lakhs)
- ❌ GPS-based apps: Easily spoofed with fake location apps
- ❌ Face recognition apps: Friend can verify from different classroom
- ❌ Manual attendance: Time-consuming, prone to proxy marking
- ❌ RFID cards: Can be shared, lost, or forgotten

**Result:** 30-40% proxy attendance in most colleges

---

## 💡 The LetsBunk Solution

### **Triple-Layer Security Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 1: Identity Verification (Face Recognition)     │
│  ✓ Proves WHO you are                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 2: Campus Verification (WiFi BSSID)             │
│  ✓ Proves you're ON CAMPUS                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 3: Proximity Verification (Ultrasonic Mesh)     │
│  ✓ Proves you're IN THE CLASSROOM                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**All three must pass. No exceptions.**

## 🔥 Revolutionary Features

### 1. **Cascading Ultrasonic Mesh Network**

**The Game Changer:**

When a teacher initiates a random attendance check:

1. **Teacher's phone emits ultrasonic signal** (18-22 kHz, inaudible to humans)
2. **First benchers detect signal** → verify face + WiFi → become relay nodes
3. **They emit signal** → middle rows detect → verify → become relay nodes
4. **Cascade continues** → back benchers verify → entire class verified in 60 seconds
5. **Student in different classroom?** → No signal received → **FLAGGED**

**Why it's impossible to fool:**
- Ultrasonic waves don't penetrate walls/doors
- Can't be spoofed with software
- Creates peer-to-peer verification mesh
- Self-organizing, no infrastructure needed

---

### 2. **Smart Random Ring System**

**Traditional Problem:** Students verify once in morning, then leave campus

**LetsBunk Solution:**
- Teacher triggers random checks during lectures (2-3 times per day)
- Selected students get 2-minute notification
- Must verify: Face + WiFi + Ultrasonic
- Failure = Automatic absence marking
- Parents get instant notification

**Result:** Students must stay in classroom entire lecture

---

### 3. **WiFi BSSID Verification**

**Not just "connected to WiFi" - we verify the exact access point:**

```javascript
Authorized BSSIDs:
├── 00:11:22:33:44:55 → Classroom 101
├── 00:11:22:33:44:56 → Classroom 102
├── 00:11:22:33:44:57 → Library
└── 00:11:22:33:44:58 → Auditorium
```

**Benefits:**
- Can't use VPN or mobile hotspot
- Tracks which building/room student is in
- Works even if student has multiple WiFi networks saved


---

### 4. **Real-Time Parent Engagement App**

**Parents see everything in real-time:**

**Morning:**
```
✅ 9:05 AM - Rohan entered college
✅ 9:15 AM - Period 1 started (Mathematics)
```

**During Day:**
```
🔔 11:30 AM - Random check initiated
✅ 11:31 AM - Rohan verified (Wave 2)
```

**Alerts:**
```
❌ 2:30 PM - ALERT: Random check failed
📞 Automated call: "Your child was absent in Period 5"
```

**Weekly Reports:**
```
📊 This week: 5/5 days present (100%)
📈 Attendance trend: Improving
🎯 Subject-wise: Math 95%, Physics 90%
```

**Why parents love it:**
- Zero guesswork - know exactly where child is
- Instant notifications - no waiting for monthly reports
- Can't hide bunking - parents know immediately
- Direct communication with teachers

---

### 5. **Intelligent Attendance Tracking**

**Not just "present/absent" - we track everything:**

**Per Lecture:**
- Subject name
- Time attended (minutes)
- Total lecture duration
- Attendance percentage
- Present/Absent status (≥75% = Present)

**Daily Summary:**
- Total time in college
- Lectures attended vs total
- Day percentage
- Entry/exit times

**Semester Analytics:**
- Overall attendance percentage
- Subject-wise breakdown
- Trend analysis
- Defaulter predictions


---

### 6. **Dynamic Timetable System**

**No more hardcoded schedules:**

- Timetables stored in database
- Teachers can edit via admin panel
- Changes reflect instantly on all student apps
- Period-wise tracking with exact timings
- Automatic class detection based on current time
- Break time exclusion from attendance calculation

**Example:**
```
Current Period: Data Structures (12:30 PM - 1:30 PM)
Time Remaining: 23 minutes
Attendance: 37/60 minutes (61%)
Status: Timer running ⏱️
```

---

### 7. **One-Time Daily Face Verification**

**Smart design to reduce server load:**

- Face verification required once per day (morning)
- Timer runs continuously after verification
- Random rings use cached face data
- Reduces server processing by 90%
- Works offline after initial verification

**But with random rings:**
- Periodic spot checks ensure physical presence
- Can't verify and leave campus
- Must stay in classroom entire day

---

## 🎯 How It Works (Student Journey)

### **Morning (9:00 AM)**
```
1. Student opens app
2. Face verification (one-time for the day)
3. WiFi BSSID check (on campus?)
4. Timer starts automatically
5. Parent gets notification: "Child entered college"
```

### **During Lectures (9:15 AM - 4:10 PM)**
```
1. Timer runs continuously
2. Tracks time per lecture
3. Calculates attendance percentage
4. Auto-saves to server every 5 minutes
```

### **Random Ring (Anytime)**
```
1. Teacher presses "Random Ring" button
2. Teacher's phone emits ultrasonic signal
3. 10-20 random students get notification
4. Students have 2 minutes to verify:
   - Face recognition ✓
   - WiFi BSSID ✓
   - Ultrasonic signal ✓
5. Verified students become relay nodes
6. Cascade continues until all verified
7. Failed students flagged + parents notified
```


### **End of Day (4:10 PM)**
```
1. Timer stops automatically
2. Daily attendance calculated
3. Saved to database
4. Parent gets summary notification
5. If absent: Automated call to parents
```
