# Security Audit: Time Manipulation Vulnerability

## CRITICAL VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Students can manipulate device time to mark attendance for any day

## Vulnerability Description

Despite implementing server time synchronization, the app was still using **device time** in critical attendance-related functions. This allowed students to:

1. Change their device date/time
2. Mark attendance for future or past days
3. Bypass the Sunday leave day restriction
4. Manipulate attendance records

## Root Cause

The app had **fallback code** that used `new Date()` and `Date.now()` when server time was unavailable. However, these fallbacks were being used even when server time WAS available, because the code wasn't properly calling `getServerTime()` in many places.

## Critical Vulnerable Code Locations

### 1. **App.js Line 568** - MOST CRITICAL
```javascript
// VULNERABLE CODE
return {
  date: new Date().toDateString(),  // ❌ Uses device time!
  lectures: updatedLectures,
  ...
};
```

This is where attendance records are saved. Using device time here means students can manipulate the attendance date.

### 2. **App.js Line 738** - Attendance History
```javascript
// VULNERABLE CODE
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date();  // ❌ Uses device time!
```

### 3. **TeacherDashboard.js** - Multiple Locations
- Line 44: `new Date().toLocaleDateString()` for fetching schedule
- Line 54: `new Date()` for finding current class
-
